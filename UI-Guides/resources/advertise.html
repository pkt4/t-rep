<h1>Getting Started </h1>
<div id="D-get-started-intro">

<h2>Apps</h2>
<div id="D-apps-box">
<h3>Start by creating an App</h3>
<p>Adding an App can be as easy as just entering the app’s store URL, and the details of the app will be automatically retrieved. But there is also the option to specify the details by hand. Media assets are uploaded and stored for each app and they can be shared across all campaigns of the same app. Suspending all the campaigns of an app takes only one click, for setting the particular app as Inactive.</p>
</div>

<h2>Campaigns</h2>
<div id="D-campaigns-box">
<h3>… then create Campaigns</h3>
<p>Multiple campaigns can lie under the same app (however, a campaign can belong only to a single app). Numerous parameters are available for modelling the characteristics of a campaign (e.g. bidding, budgeting, targeting, etc.). The campaign’s media assets can be picked from the app’s existing collection or new ones can be directly uploaded. Each campaign can be individually set to run as scheduled or forced to stop. </p>
</div>

<h2>Billing</h2>
<div id="D-billing-box">
<h3>Check and replenish account’s Balance</h3>
<p>Campaigns are funded by the credit that is available, thus the current balance should be sufficient for running the active campaigns. Refilling the account can be done through PayPal or Wire transfer, while bonus credits can be rewarded in the context of Minimob’s customer loyalty programs.</p>
</div>

<h2>Reports</h2>
<div id="D-reports-box">
<h3>View Reports</h3>
<p>Performance and monetary information for campaigns and apps (such as clicks, conversions, conversion rates and amount spent) is reported. The way that results are grouped is configurable while it is possible to zoom in and view more detailed information for each group. The reported metrics can be filtered while their evolution over time is graphically presented in comprehensive charts. </p>

<div id="D-app-list">
<h3>Apps List</h3>
<p>At the <b>Apps</b> menu, you can create a new app (by clicking <b>New App</b>) as well as see and manage the apps that you have already created. </p>

Clicking on the name of an app opens a new tab where you can view and edit the details of the particular app. You can have multiple tabs open at the same time, but if you navigate away from the <b>Apps</b> menu, they will all be closed.</p>
<p>The number of <b>Clicks</b> and <b>Conversions</b> as well as the <b>Cost</b> for each app across all its campaigns are presented, along with the number of campaigns that are currently active.</p>
<p>Under <b>Status</b>, you can see or select whether an app is <b>Active</b> or not. If you make an app <b>Inactive</b> then all associated campaigns are paused, i.e. are not marketed through Minimob.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<div id="D-campaign-creation">
<h6>Campaign creation</h6>
<p>To create a new campaign, you need to specify its name as well as the other required details, and then click <b>Create</b>. Note that you cannot change the app of the campaign after the creation of the campaign. The default state of the new campaign is <b>Inactive</b>; you can activate it later on, after you have completed setting up the details of the campaign.</p>

<p>Note that the campaign cannot run until mandatory details are specified and unless certain conditions are satisfied. In such cases, the relevant notifications are displayed. Clicking on a notification directs you to the exact point where your input or action is required. </p>
</div>
<div id="D-campaign-schedule">
<h6>Schedule</h6>
<p>Optionally, you can set the <b>Start</b> and <b>End</b> date of the campaign. Click on the corresponding calendar icon to select a date. While at the calendar view, you may click on the watch icon to specify the time as well. If you do not specify the time, the current time is used.</p>
<p>If you do not specify a <b>Start</b> date, the campaign starts immediately after being activated. If you do not specify an <b>End</b> date, the campaign will continue to run as long as it is <b>Active</b>. </p>
</div>
<div id="D-campaign-targeting">
<h6>Targeting</h6>
<p>The values for <b>OS Platform</b> and <b>App Store</b> are always inherited from the app and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>The <b>Traffic Type</b> can be only Incentivized, only Non-Incentivized, both or neither. </p>
<p>Click on <b>Target Countries</b> to search by name and select one or more countries to target.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-campaign-bidding">
<h6>Bidding and Budgeting</h6>
<p>Click on <b>Model</b> and select one of the supported pricing models, i.e. CPI (Cost-Per-Install) or CPA (Cost-Per-Action). Then, specify the <b>Bid</b> price; the currency of the bid price is always in USD.</p>
<p>In order to be allowed to define Caps, you must have first specified a <b>Bid</b> price. Once so, you can select either <b>Conversions</b> or <b>Budget</b> to set Conversion or Budget caps respectively. If you select <b>Conversions</b> then Budget caps are automatically calculated and vice versa; if you specify Budget caps, the calculated values for the conversions are rounded to the nearest integer.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-campaign-tracking">
<h6>Tracking</h6>
<p>The Minimob platform employs postback tracking (a.k.a. “server-side tracking”) for keeping track of conversions. When serving a campaign through our affiliate ad networks, the <b>Click URL</b> contains parameters that identify the campaign and each individual click action for the particular campaign, while it can also carry information about the ad network. </p>
<p>This information should be stored on your side and, upon a conversion, fired back to Minimob via the <b>Postback URL</b>, in order to correlate the specific conversion with the corresponding user transaction that was achieved through the respective ad network. </p>
<p>In this way, each conversion can be properly tracked and credited to the corresponding marketing partner, while it also helps to understand the analytics of the campaigns and thus to improve its performance.</p>
<p>Click the <b>Edit</b> button to view instructions about generating and integrating the relevant Click URL and Postback URL for this campaign.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-campaign-mediaassets">
<h6>Media assets</h6>
<p>To add a new media asset to the campaign, click <b>New Media asset</b>. A pop-up is displayed where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a media asset that is already uploaded to the relevant app: At the <b>App Media assets</b> list, click the switch under the <b>Used in this Campaign</b> column to add or remove the corresponding media asset from the particular campaign. <b><u><u>Note</u></u></b>: Deleting a media asset from the <b>App Media assets</b> list deletes it from the app (and all its underlying campaigns).</li>
<li>Upload a new media asset: browse for an image file or drag and drop it on the image placeholder. The new media asset is automatically added to the corresponding app and it is made <b>Active</b> for the particular campaign. </li>
</ul>

<p>Clicking the <b>Configure</b> button next to a media asset of the campaign displays a page for configuring its properties. The properties of a media asset can also be configured when editing the app where the campaign belongs to. Note that no matter whether the configuration of a media asset was initiated from within an app or any of the app’s underlying campaigns, the properties defined for that media asset are the same across the app and all of its campaigns.</p>
<p>In the case of configuring a video media asset, you have the option to specify an <b>End-card</b> (i.e. an image that is shown after the video has finished). End-card images can be selected from images already uploaded for the app, or new images can be uploaded. New images are promptly assigned to the video media asset while by default they are allowed to be used only in the context of video ads. However, it is possible to change this by configuring the properties of the particular image media asset and specifying that it can be used for any ad.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Tip</strong>: It is advised not to mix images and videos under the same campaign. If you want to use videos, you can create a separate campaign whose media assets are only videos. In this way you can use different settings (e.g. payouts) for video campaigns.</blockquote></div>

<div id="D-campaign-startstop">
