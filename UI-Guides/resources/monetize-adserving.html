<h1>Getting Started </h1>
<div id="D-get-started-intro">
<h6>Introduction</h6>
<p>Minimob’s dashboard for Ad Serving is a self-service tool that enables Developers to monetize the advertising space in their apps. Through the dashboard, Developers can quickly and effortlessly set up their apps and ad zones, as well as monitor their performance and revenues. </p>
</div>

<h2>Apps</h2>
<div id="D-apps-box">
<h3>Start by creating an App</h3>
<p>Adding an App can be as easy as just entering the app’s store URL, and the details of the app will be automatically retrieved. But there is also the option to specify the details by hand. The advertising space within an app is managed by creating and setting up the corresponding Ad Zones. Suspending all the ad zones of an app takes only one click, i.e. setting the particular app as Inactive.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ad Zones</h2>
<div id="D-adzones-box">
<h3>… then create Ad Zones</h3>
<p>Multiple ad zones can lie under the same app (however, an ad zone can belong only to a single app). An Ad Zone is essentially a representation of a particular advertising area allocated within the app. Several parameters are available for shaping each ad zone, i.e. for defining how to fill the advertising space. Each ad zone can be individually started or stopped, while integration with the Minimob platform is practically just embedding a JavaScript ad tag (for each ad zone) to the app. </p>
</div>

<h2>Reports</h2>
<div id="D-reports-box">
<h3>View Reports and Revenues</h3>
<p>Performance and monetary information for apps and their ad zones (such as clicks, conversions, conversion rates and revenues) is reported. The way that results are grouped is configurable while it is possible to zoom in and view more detailed information for each group. The reported metrics can be filtered while their evolution over time is graphically presented in comprehensive charts. </p>

<h2>Apps</h2>
<div id="D-app-list">
<h3>Apps List</h3>
<p>At the <b>Apps</b> menu, you can create a new app (by clicking <b>New App</b>) as well as see and manage the apps that you have already created. </p>
<p>The list displays all the created apps along with performance, monetary and other important information for each one. Clicking on the name of an app opens a new tab where you can view and edit the details of the particular app. You can have multiple tabs open at the same time, but if you navigate away from the <b>Apps</b> menu, they will all be closed.</p>
<p>Under <b>Status</b>, you can see or select whether an app is <b>Active</b> or not. If you make an app <b>Inactive</b> then all its underlying ad zones are paused, i.e. Minimob does not return a response to ad requests from these ad zones.</p>
</div>

<h3>App Overview</h3>
<div id="D-app-creation">
<h6>App creation</h6>
<p>To create a new app, you need to specify its name and then click <b>Create</b>. The default state of the new app is <b>Inactive</b>. You can activate the app later on, after you have completed setting up the details of the app.</p>
<p>The information that is displayed for the app include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Package Name</b>: the unique ID that identifies the application (e.g. <b>com.developer.appname</b> or <b>id123456789</b>)</li>
<li><b>Store url</b>: The URL through which the app is available from the relevant app store</li>
<li><b>Store</b>: The name of the app store through which the app is marketed</li>
<li><b>OS Platform</b>: The operating system of the app</li>
<li><b>App price</b>: The price tag of the app (a value of ‘0’ means the app is free)</li>
<li><b>Category</b>: The category under which the app is listed at the app store</li>
<li><b>Version</b>: The version of the app that is currently available</li>
<li><b>Updated</b>: The date of the most recent update of the app</li>
<li><b>Developer</b>: The name of the person/company who develops the app</li>

<p>After the app has been created you can proceed with adding ad zones while you can also modify the app’s details. Any modifications you make are automatically saved upon moving your cursor away from the modified field.</p>
<p>To change the app icon, you can browse and select a new image file or drag and drop it on the image placeholder.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-app-import">
<h6>App creation by Import</h6>
<p>You can specify the app’s details by hand or you can do that automatically by simply entering the app’s <b>Store URL</b> and then clicking <b>Import</b>. The details of the app are retrieved from the app store and are automatically imported. You may want to review the imported information and make any modifications, if necessary. Once done, click <b>Create</b> to create the new app.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-app-adzones">
<h6>App ad zones</h6>
<p>Once the app has been created you can proceed with adding ad zones. </p>
<p>To add a new ad zone, click <b>New Ad Zone</b>. A new tab is displayed where you can specify the ad zone’s details. The new ad zone is automatically associated with the particular app and after its creation it is added to the ad zones list of the app. </p>
<p>Under <b>Status</b>, you can see or select whether an ad zone of the particular app is <b>Active</b> or not. If you make an ad zone <b>Inactive</b> then it is paused, i.e. Minimob does not return a response to ad requests from this ad zone.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-app-startstop">
<h6>Start or Stop App </h6>
<p>Once you have completed setting up the details of the app, you can activate it by clicking on the <b>Start/Stop app</b>. Minimob does not return a response to ad requests from ad zones that belong to an app which has been stopped.</p>
</div>

<h2>Ad Zones </h2>
<div id="D-adzone-list">
<h3>Ad Zones List</h3>
<p>At the <b>Ad Zones</b> menu, you can create a new ad zone (by clicking <b>New Ad Zone</b>) as well as see and manage the ad zones that you have already created. </p>

Clicking on the name of an ad zone opens a new tab where you can view or edit the details of the particular ad zone. In addition, clicking on the name of the app (to which the ad zone belongs) opens a new tab where you can view or edit the details of the app. You can have multiple tabs open at the same time, but if you navigate away from the <b>Ad Zones</b> menu, they will all be closed.</p>
<p>The <b>Reward</b> indicator shows whether users are rewarded or not for acting on the ads displayed at the particular ad zone. </p>
<p>Under <b>Status</b>, you can see or select whether an ad zone is <b>Active</b> or not. If you make an ad zone <b>Inactive</b> then it is paused, i.e. Minimob does not return a response to ad requests from this ad zone.</p>
</div>

<h3>Ad Zone Overview</h3>
<div id="D-adzone-creation">
<h6>Ad Zone creation</h6>
<p>In order to be able to create a new ad zone, you need to specify at least: </p>
<ul>
<li>The ad zone’s name.</li>
<li>The app to which the ad zone belongs. Note that you cannot change the app of the ad zone after the creation of the ad zone.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can specify further details and then click <b>Create</b>. Note that some settings can be configured only after the ad zone has been created.</p>
<p>Once the ad zone has been created, any modifications that you make are automatically saved upon moving the cursor away from the modified field.</p>
<p>The default state of the new ad zone is <b>Inactive</b>; you can activate it later on, after you have completed setting up the details of the ad zone.</p>
</div>

<div id="D-adzone-placement">
<h6>Video Ad Placement</h6>
<p>Ad placement refers to the characteristics of the container in which the ads are displayed. </p>
<p>Currently, Minimob supports displaying video ads as Interstitials (Full-screen), where the video ad covers the entire screen of the mobile device.</p>
</div>

<div id="D-adzone-filtering">
<h6>Filtering</h6>
<p>You can exclude video ads that exceed a certain duration. Use the <b>Max video duration</b> option to specify a maximum video duration. Video ads that exceed the specified duration will not be qualified (and hence displayed) for this ad zone. Note that all video ads have a minimum duration of 5 seconds.</p>
</div>

<div id="D-adzone-controls">
<h6>Controls</h6>
<p>You can regulate the user experience by controlling the interaction with the video ads.</p>
<p>The following control options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Skippable</b>: control whether the user is allowed to skip the ad (i.e. user is allowed to close the video ad during playback, after the first 5 seconds have elapsed) or not (i.e. user is allowed to close the video ad only after it has finished playing). </li>
<li><b>Ad Zone Frequency Cap</b>: specify the maximum number of ad impressions that can be served to the same user within the same day through this ad zone. For each unique user, Minimob will not serve more ads than the value specified, per day.</li>
</ul></div>

<div id="D-adzone-videotracking">
<h6>Video Ad Rewarding based on VAST Events Tracking </h6>
<p>There are several video ad events that can be tracked and used for rewarding: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start</strong>: fired shortly after ad has begun playing</li>
<li><strong>First Quartile</strong>:  fired when 25% of ad duration has been played</li>
<li><strong>Midpoint</strong>: fired when 50% of ad duration has been played</li>
<li><strong>Third Quartile</strong>: fired when 75% of ad duration has been played</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong>: fired at the end of the ad</li>
</ul>
<p>For each one, you can specify a separate postback URL at which Minimob will notify you about. Note that you must first create the Ad Zone in order to be able to configure the triggering events.</p>
<p><b>Tip</b>: When rewarding your users for interacting with an ad, take into consideration the payout model based on which you earn revenue – for example, if you get paid when users install and open an advertised app, you may not want to reward users just for starting to watch the video ad.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-adzone-rewarding">
<h6>Video Ad Rewarding based on Conversions</h6>
<p>You can specify if users will be incentivized to install and then open the apps advertised through this ad zone. </p>
<p>If so, you need to specify the <strong>Conversion Tracking Postback URL</strong> that Minimob will use in order to notify you accordingly. </p>
<blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: When this option is selected, this ad zone receives only ads which are allowed to be promoted over incentivized traffic. In such case, you should bear in mind that ads for incentivized traffic have lower payouts than ads for non-incentivized traffic.</blockquote></div>
<div id="D-adzone-integration">
<h6>Integration</h6>
<p>Once you create the Ad Zone, the corresponding <strong>Ad Tag Script</strong> is automatically generated and displayed. </p>
<p>Integration with the app requires that you copy the generated script and add it into the relevant html page of the app. </p>
<p>As long as both the Ad Zone and the relevant App are set as <b>Active</b>, ad requests will be responded, returning and serving suitable ads to the app users.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-adzone-startstop">
<h6>Start or Stop Ad Zone </h6>
<p>Once you have completed setting up the details of the ad zone, you can activate it by clicking on the <b>Start/Stop Ad Zone</b>. Minimob does not return a response to ad requests from an ad zone that has been stopped.</p>
</div>
