<h1>Quick Guide for API Offers</h1>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<div id="D-get-started-intro">
<h6>Introduction</h6>
<p><strong>API Offers</strong> is an online marketplace within Minimob through which Publishers and Ad Networks can find offers sourced from top-rated advertising partners, assess them (e.g. their payouts, available GEOs, volume CAPs, etc.) and then select the most suitable ones for monetizing their traffic.</p>
</div>

<h3>[Tracking and Integration] - Gear up for integration</h3>
<div id="D-api-box">
<h4>Set up tracking options and test API calls </h4>
<p>Flexible setup of tracking and postback options provides support for incentivized offers and for adapting to different conversion scenarios according to the particular needs of each publisher. </p>
<p>Ad serving can be automated and streamlined through direct API calls, which enable integration so that offers can be served with the preferred ad serving technology platform.</p>
</div>

<h3>[Available API Offers] - Go through available offers</h3>
<div id="D-all-offers-box">
<h4>Pick your favorites out of all available offers</h4>
<p>Offers sourced from top-rated advertising partners are periodically and automatically fetched and imported into Minimob’s database. The offers are reviewed by Minimob moderators to make sure they meet the relevant specifications for being promoted by publishers. </p>
<p>Once verified, offers and their details are posted to our marketplace so you can go through them and decide which ones you would like to promote. Pick the ones you are interested in and then request approval for them.</p>
</div>

<h3>[My API Offers] - Monetize your inventory</h3>
<div id="D-my-offers-box">
<h4>Make profit from offers approved for you</h4>
<p>Offers for which the publisher’s request has been approved can be promoted through the publisher’s inventory.  Provided tracking options have been configured properly, successful conversions are attributed accordingly and publishers are compensated with the respective payouts.</p>
<p>You may start running the offers that you have been given approval, while useful information and feedback about the quality and status of your offers can help you to optimize the monetization from your traffic.</p>
</div>

<h3>[Reports] - View Reports and Revenues</h3>
<div id="D-api-reports-box">
<h4>Monitor progress, performance and earnings</h4>
<p>Performance and monetary information for your offers (such as clicks, conversions, conversion rates and revenues) is reported. The way that results are grouped is configurable while it is possible to zoom in and view more detailed information for each group. The reported metrics can be filtered while their evolution over time is graphically presented in comprehensive charts.</p>
</div>

<div id="D-all-offers">
<h2>Available API Offers</h2>
<p>Offers listed under <strong>Available API Offers</strong> are offers sourced from top-rated advertising partners that are available to be promoted by publishers. </p>
<p>You can sort or filter the list. The filtering options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: where you can select to view: only those offers for which have requested approval (i.e. <strong>Pending Approval</strong>), or only those that remain available for selection (i.e. <strong>Available</strong>), or all of them.</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong>: the platform of offers</li>
<li><strong>Country</strong>: the countries that offers targets</li>
<li><strong>Store</strong>: the app store of offers</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Type</strong>: the traffic type of offers</li>
</ul>

<p>To view more detailed information about a particular offer, click on the offer’s name.</p>
<p>In this way, you can identify those offers that you want to promote and proceed with requesting approval for them.</p>

<h5>Finding the best performing offers </h5>
<p>You can find the offers that exhibit high performance and quality by: </p>
<ul>
<li>checking the respective Quality Score </li>
<li>typing on the search bar <strong>** HOT</strong> to display the HOT offers of the day </li>
</ul>

<h5>Requesting approval to promote an offer</h5>
<p>To promote offers that are listed in <strong>Available API Offers</strong>, publishers must request approval for each offer individually. </p>
<p>To request approval for an offer, select the offer from the list and click the <strong>Request Approval</strong> button next to it.</p>
<p>To request approvals for multiple offers, select them from the list and then click the <strong>Request All Selected</strong> button at the top row.</p>
<p>Approval requests are moderated by the <em>Minimob</em> team, who review the offers that you have requested and decide whether to approve your requests or not, taking into consideration your profile as a publisher and the parameters of each requested offer. If for example, an offer is about to be paused in short-term, it is likely that approval requests for the particular offer will be rejected. </p>
</div>

<div id="D-my-offers">
<h2>My API Offers</h2>
<p>Offers listed under <strong>My API Offers</strong> are the offers for which the publisher’s request has been approved and which the specific publisher can therefore promote. </p>
<p>You can sort or filter the list. The filtering options include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform</strong>: the platform of offers</li>
<li><strong>Country</strong>: show only offers that run at the selected countries. As the same offer may run in more countries than those selected, the statistics in the table refer to the offer’s performance for all the countries it runs. To display statistics that refer only to the selected countries (i.e. excluding the statistics from countries that are not selected), enable <strong>Single Country Stats</strong> by clicking on the corresponding button</li>
<li><strong>Store</strong>: the app store of offers</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Type</strong>: the traffic type of offers</li>
<li><strong>Cap Status</strong>: where you can select to view: only offers whose cap has already been reached, or only those whose cap has not been reached, or all of them</li>
<li><strong>Offer Status</strong>: where you can select to view: only <strong>Active</strong> offers, only <strong>Inactive</strong> offers or all of them</li>
<li><strong>Clicks</strong>: filter based on the number of clicks for the current day (UTC)</li>
<li><strong>Conversions</strong>: filter based on the number of conversions for the current day (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<p>Offers highlighted in reddish color indicate offers that have been halted, but you are still pushing. Offers highlighted in yellowish color indicate offers that have reached the daily CAP. </p>
<blockquote><strong>Tip</strong>: Besides emailing to you newsletters and notifications about the status of offers, color highlighting of offers is another measure to draw your attention and help you detect cases for which action needs to be taken on your side, e.g. stop pushing halted offers or temporarily pause pushing offers until the next day.</blockquote>

<h5>Viewing an offer’s quality score per country</h5>
<p>While viewing the <strong>My API Offers</strong> list, click on an offer’s consolidated quality score to view the respective quality score per country, for that offer.</p>

<h5>Viewing the details of an offer</h5>
<p>While viewing the <strong>My API Offers</strong> list, click on the name of an offer in the list to view more detailed information about that offer. A pop-up is displayed which contains details for the particular offer, such as GEOs, payout, description, CAPs and other restrictions offer might have. </p>
<p>At the <strong>App</strong> tab, you can find information about the relevant app.</p>
<p>At the <strong>Creatives</strong> tab, you can preview and download the associated creatives.</p>
<p>At the <strong>Quality Score</strong> tab, you can view the respective quality score per country, for the particular offer.</p>

<h5>Removing an offer from the ‘My API Offers’ list</h5>
<p>Offers that you no longer want to promote can be deleted from the <strong>My API Offers</strong> list.</p>
<p>While viewing the <strong>My API Offers</strong> list: </p>
<ul>
<li>To delete an offer, click the <strong>Delete</strong> button next to it.</li>
<li>To delete multiple offers, select them from the list and then click the <strong>Delete Selected</strong> button at the top row.</li>
</ul></div>

<h2>API</h2>
<p>At the <strong>API</strong> menu, you can configure the tracking and postback URLs in order to support the conversion scenario that you use, while you can also view and test run the provided API calls.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<div id="D-introduction-configuration">
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The <strong>Click URL</strong> and <strong>Postback URL</strong> are used for tracking and measuring clicks and conversions. </p>
<p>At the <em>Configuration</em> tab under the <em>API</em> menu, you can view and configure the <strong>Click URL</strong> and <strong>Postback URL</strong> for your offers. Flexible setup enables support for incentivized offers and different conversion scenarios.</p>
<p>The following types of parameters are used for defining the URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory not editable parameters</strong>: these parameters are created by Minimob. By default, they are included in the URL and it is not allowed to remove them. The users cannot change their name or value (the <strong>Edit</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong> buttons are not available for these parameters).</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory editable parameters</strong>: these parameters are created by Minimob. By default, they are included in the URL and it is not allowed to remove them.  The users can edit their value but not their name (only the <strong>Edit</strong> button is available for these parameters).</li>
<li><strong>Optional editable parameters</strong>: these are custom parameters that can be optionally included in the URL. They are created by the users. The users are allowed to edit their names and values (both the <strong>Edit</strong> and the <strong>Delete</strong> buttons are available for these parameters).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use macros for specifying the values of editable parameters. In this way, you essentially insert a placeholder whose value is determined at run-time:</p>
<ul>
<li>By the user’s system, for the case of <strong>Click URL</strong> parameters.</li>
<li>By Minimob, for the case of <strong>Postback URL</strong> parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have completed the changes, click <strong>Save Configuration</strong> at the bottom of the page.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-clickurl-configuration">
<h4>Click URL configuration</h4>
<p>The <strong>Click URL</strong> is the link for redirecting the end user to the app store for downloading the app, as well as for notifying Minimob when a user clicks on the offer. </p>
<blockquote><strong>Attention</strong>: It is necessary that Minimob gets notified through the <strong>Click URL</strong> every time an end user clicks on an offer. Failure to do so may lead to loss of reimbursement.</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Click URL</strong> consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the tracking URL: <strong>clicks.minimob.com/tracking/click?</strong> </li>
<li>URL parameters: </li>
<ul>
<li><strong>trafficsource</strong> [<em>mandatory not editable</em>]: the unique id which has been assigned by Minimob to your traffic source.</li>
<li><strong>offerid</strong> [<em>mandatory not editable</em>]: a unique id that identifies the particular campaign through which the offer is being promoted.</li>
<li><strong>clickid</strong> [<em>mandatory editable</em>]: a parameter for holding the click id that corresponds to an action of a mobile device user. Note that Minimob users can edit the value of this parameter but not its name. On every click, the user’s system must replace the clickid placeholder with a unique value that corresponds to that particular click action.</li>
<li>custom parameters [<em>optional editable</em>]: any additional parameters that you may want to define and include in the URL.</li>
</ul></ul>
<p>For the custom parameters, you can specify any value for the parameter while for its name you can: </p>
<ul>
<li>Specify a custom name. </li>
<li>Pick one of the predefined options that are available for selection, i.e. the system-generated <strong>gaid</strong>, <strong>idfa</strong> and <strong>pub_subid</strong>. Note that once the parameter is created (i.e. saved), you are not allowed to edit its name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters <strong>gaid</strong> and <strong>idfa</strong> are used so that you can pass to Minimob the unique advertising identifiers of Android and iOS mobile device users, respectively. The <strong>pub_subid</strong> parameter is used for passing the unique id (that you have assigned) of the traffic source from which the transaction originates. The values configured for these parameters are essentially placeholders that will be replaced with the actual values during run-time, by your ad serving system.</p>
<p>To add an optional parameter, click the <b>Add Parameter</b> button at the top of the parameters list.</p>
<p>To edit a customizable parameter, click the <b>Edit Parameter</b> icon.</p>
<p>To delete an optional parameter, click the <b>Delete Parameter</b> icon.</p>
</div>


<div id="D-postbackurl-configuration">
<h4>Postback URL configuration</h4>
<p>This is the URL where Minimob notifies about a conversion which is attributed to this particular user.</p>
<p>It consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the postback URL: this is defined by the user and must have the following format: http://yourPostbackURL</li>
<li>URL parameters [<em>optional editable</em>]: these are custom parameters that you can optionally include in the URL. You can specify any name for the parameter while for its value you can: </li>
<ul>
<li>Pick one of the predefined values that are available for selection, i.e. the system-generated <strong>timestamp</strong> and <strong>conversion_id</strong> as well as the values of the parameters defined for the <strong>Click URL.</strong> Note that once the parameter is created (i.e. saved), you are not allowed to edit its value.</li>
<li>Specify a new value. Note that the value specified is a fixed value and not a placeholder for a dynamically updated value as in the case of selecting one of the predefined values.</li>
</ul></ul>
<p>To add a parameter, click the <b>Add Parameter</b> button at the top of the parameters list.</p>
<p>To edit a parameter, click the <b>Edit Parameter</b> icon.</p>
<p>To delete a parameter, click the <b>Delete Parameter</b> icon.</p>
</div>

<div id="D-example-configuration">
<h4>Step-by-step example</h4>
<h5>Configuring the Click URL</h5>
<p>The mandatory parameters are by default included in the URL. At any time, the <strong>Preview Click URL</strong> field shows how the URL looks like based on what has been configured so far, which initially should be like the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums=5"><code>http://clicks.minimob.com/tracking/click?clickid=[[clickid]]&trafficsource=[[trafficsource]]&offerid=[[offerid]] </code></pre>
<p>Assume you want to include a custom parameter named <strong>credits</strong> to the <strong>Click URL</strong> and that your system is configured to replace the placeholder <strong>[[credits]]</strong> with the actual parameter’s value during run-time. </p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Parameter</strong> button.</li>
<li>At the pop-up that is displayed, type <strong>credits</strong> at the <em>Name</em> field. </li>
<li>Type <strong>[[credits]]</strong> at the <em>Value</em> field and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The URL preview now reads:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums=5"><code>http://clicks.minimob.com/tracking/click?clickid=[[clickid]]&trafficsource=[[trafficsource]]&offerid=[[offerid]]&credits=[[credits]] </code></pre>
<p>Assume you want to modify the placeholder of the value of the <strong>clickid</strong> parameter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button at the row of the <strong>clickid</strong> parameter.</li>
<li>At the pop-up that is displayed, specify a different value at the <em>Value</em> field. For example: <strong>{clkid}</strong>. Note that it is not necessary to enclose the value in <strong>[[…]]</strong> but you are free to use any notation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting URL preview is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums=5"><code>http://clicks.minimob.com/tracking/click?clickid={clkid}&trafficsource=[[trafficsource]]&offerid=[[offerid]]&credits=[[credits]] </code></pre>
<p>Click <strong>Save Configuration</strong> at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h5>Configuring the Postback URL</h5>
<p>Specify the <strong>Postback URL</strong>. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums=5"><code>http://www.mypostbackurl.com</code></pre>
<p>You can see how the URL looks like based on what has been configured so far at the <strong>Preview Postback URL</strong> field. </p>
<p>Assume you want Minimob to include to the <strong>Postback URL</strong> the respective value of the <strong>clickid</strong> parameter. </p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Parameter</strong> button.</li>
<li>At the pop-up that is displayed, select <strong>[[clickid]]</strong> from the drop-down list at the <em>Value</em> field. </li>
<li>Specify the parameter’s name at the <em>Name</em> field. For example: <strong>pbclickid</strong>. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The URL preview now reads:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums=5"><code>http://www.mypostbackurl.com?pbclickid=[[clickid]] </code></pre>
<p>During run-time, Minimob will replace the placeholder <strong>[[clickid]]</strong> with the respective actual value of the parameter.</p>
<p>Assume you want to include the respective value of the <strong>credits</strong> custom parameter that you have defined when configuring the <strong>Click URL</strong>. </p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Parameter</strong> button.</li>
<li>At the pop-up that is displayed, select <strong>[[credits]]</strong> from the drop-down list at the <em>Value</em> field. </li>
<li>Specify the parameter’s name at the <em>Name</em> field. For example: <strong>crds</strong>. Note that the name of the parameter does not have to be the same as the one used for the <strong>Click URL</strong>. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The URL preview now reads:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums=5"><code>http://www.mypostbackurl.com?pbclickid=[[clickid]]&crds=[[credits]] </code></pre>
<p>During run-time, Minimob will replace the placeholder <strong>[[credits]]</strong> with the respective actual value of the parameter.</p>
<p>Assume you want to include the <strong>conversion_id</strong> (which is generated by the Minimob system).</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Parameter</strong> button.</li>
<li>At the pop-up that is displayed, select <strong>[[conversion_id]]</strong> from the drop-down list at the <em>Value</em> field. </li>
<li>Specify the parameter’s name at the <em>Name</em> field. For example: <strong>convid</strong>. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The URL preview now reads:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums=5"><code>http://www.mypostbackurl.com?pbclickid=[[clickid]]&crds=[[credits]]&convid=[[conversion_id]]  </code></pre>
<p>During run-time, Minimob will replace the placeholder <strong>[[conversion_id]]</strong> with the respective actual value of the parameter.</p>
<p>Assume you want to include a custom parameter named <strong>platform</strong> to the <strong>Postback URL</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Add Parameter</strong> button.</li>
<li>At the pop-up that is displayed, select <strong>Custom</strong> from the drop-down list at the <em>Value</em> field and specify a value. For example: <strong>minimob</strong>. Note that this is not a placeholder for a dynamically updated value but it is a fixed value. </li>
<li>Type <strong>platform</strong> at the <em>Name</em> field. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting URL preview is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums=5"><code>http://www.mypostbackurl.com?pbclickid=[[clickid]]&crds=[[credits]]&convid=[[conversion_id]]&platform=minimob </code></pre>
<p>Click <strong>Save Configuration</strong> at the bottom of the page.</p>
</div>
<div id="D-nextstep-configuration">
<h4>Moving ahead</h4>
<p>Having completed the configuration of the <strong>Click URL</strong> and <strong>Postback URL</strong>, you are now ready to run your offers and to receive conversion postbacks.</p>
<h5>Obtaining the Click and Postback URLs of your offers</h5>
<p>Based on the click and postback URL settings that you have configured, each of your offers gets its own dedicated tracking and postback links. </p>
<p>So, provided that you have approval to promote an offer, go to the <strong>My API Offers</strong> menu and click on the specific offer. Then, at the bottom of the popup window that appears you can find the <strong>Click URL</strong> and <strong>Postback URL</strong>, which are the dedicated tracking and postback links for the specific offer.</p>
<h5>Automating offer importing using API</h5>
<p>Minimob offers an API through which Publishers can automate the process of importing offers from Minimob’s marketplace and use the ad serving technology platform of their choice.</p>
<p>To learn more about how to use the <strong>API</strong> for importing offers to your preferred ad serving system, visit <a href="#two-info">API 1.0</a> or <a href="#three-info">API 1.1</a> </p>
</div>

<h3>API 1.0</h3>
<div id="D-introduction-api10">
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The purpose of the Minimob API for Monetization is to help you to implement automated offer importing to your system by using the ad serving technology platform of your choice. Note that this is NOT an ad serving API to be used for direct ad serving.</p>
<p>This API allows access to the following Minimob resources:</p>

<h4>My Offers</h4>
<p>This API Call returns the details of each and every offer that you have been approved to promote.</p>
<p>The results are returned in one or more pages, each one carrying a maximum of 200 offers. Each page returned contains a URL pointing to the next set of offers, assuming that there are more offers remaining to be fetched. Note that the actual number of offers that are eventually included in a page may be less than the maximum, because changes to the status of some offers may occur from the time that the API call was made until the relevant page is fetched.</p>
<p>For example, if you have been given approval for 430 offers, the results returned for this API call would be organized in three pages; the first and the second would each contain a maximum of 200 offers while the third page would contain 30 offers. Upon making the request, you will get the first page with information about the first 200 offers, together with the URL where you can fetch the second page. Assuming that until you fetch the second page one the offers of the second page has been paused, the second page will eventually return information for 199 offers. The third page will return information for the last 30 offers (assuming that none of them has been paused in the meantime) and a null-valued URL for the next page to fetch, which is the signal that the request returned the final and last page of the results. </p>
<blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: In order to better serve requests for this API call, the same user is not allowed to make more than one request per second (otherwise Error 409 is returned).</blockquote>

<h6>Notes about Pausing of Offers</h6>
<p>There are certain circumstances and conditions where an offer may be paused. Pausing of an offer can apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally to all the countries of the offer </li>
<li>To specific countries of the offer</li>
</ul>
<p>For describing the status of the offer, the <strong>runningStatus</strong> and <b>reactivationEstimatedTime</b> parameters are used, both at the offer level (i.e. across all countries) and at the country level (i.e. for each country individually). In order for an offer to run in a country, <strong>runningStatus</strong> needs to have the value <i>Running</i> both at the offer level and at the country level (for the specific country).</p>
<p>General pausing of an offer occurs when either one of the daily, weekly, monthly or total cap of the offer has been reached. In this case, the offer’s overall <b>runningStatus</b> (i.e. applying to all the countries of the offer) is set to <i>Paused</i>. If the total cap has been reached, then the offer is permanently paused. If either one of the daily, weekly or monthly cap has been reached, the offer is temporarily paused and the parameter <b>reactivationEstimatedTime</b> holds the date and time (UTC) when the status of the offer is expected to switch back to <i>Running</i>. If the: </p>
<ul>
<li>Daily cap has been reached, <b>reactivationEstimatedTime</b> returns the date and time (UTC) of the start of the next day. </li>
<li>Weekly cap has been reached, <b>reactivationEstimatedTime</b> returns the date and time (UTC) of the start of the next Monday. </li>
<li>Monthly cap has been reached, <b>reactivationEstimatedTime</b> returns the date and time (UTC) of the start of next month. </li>
<li>Overall cap has been reached, <b>reactivationEstimatedTime</b> returns null. </li>
</ul>
<p>Pausing of an offer for a specific country is directly related to the quality level of the offer for that country. Minimob periodically checks the quality of the offer for each country that the offer is allowed to run. If the quality for a country does not meet the desired standards, the offer is temporarily paused for that country. In this case, the offer’s <b>runningStatus</b> for that particular country is automatically set to <i>Paused</i> while the parameter (at country level) <b>reactivationEstimatedTime</b> holds the date and time (UTC) when the status of the offer is expected to switch back to <i>Running</i>. The quality detection and control mechanism is entirely programmatic and automated so the estimated date and time is only indicative and it may be changing frequently, while the status of the offer may change to <i>Running</i> before the estimated date and time. </p>
<p>As a publisher, you are strongly advised to respect a campaign which is paused for one or more specific targeted countries, and temporarily suspend it accordingly from your network of traffic sources. In this way you can optimize the performance of your traffic. </p>
